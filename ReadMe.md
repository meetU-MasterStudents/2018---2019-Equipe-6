# About this project

This repository ** meetU-MasterStudents/2018---2019-Equipe-6** is a C++ library providing profile-profile alignments under the form ```UBQ_foldrec```.

![PSSM](etc/PSSM.jpeg)

The project emerged while working on [AAM](https://www.github.com/cheind/aam), an active appearance models library. Fitting active appearance models is
similar to the classic image alignment problem:

> The goal of this repository is to find the best profile-profile comparison between template sequences and a target sequence by transforming them into profiles and then optimizing a profile-profile alignment. --

# Team

Our team is composed of 5 students from UPMC university. Three of us compose the biological subteam and 2 of us compose the development subteam.

# Algorithms and Packages used

## 1) Basic Local ALignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm is used to search sequence databases for optimal alignement to the [query](https://github.com/meetU-MasterStudents/2018---2019-Equipe-6/blob/master/query.fasta)

**Installation and main instructions** can be used at the following [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52640/)
**Useful Instruction** can be used at the following [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52640/)

## 2) MUltiple Sequene Comparison by Log-Expectation MUSCLE that creates multiple Alignments of our sequence database previously found. 
PARAMETRES DE MUSCLE ?? 

**Instructions** can be used at the following [link](https://petrov.stanford.edu/software/src/muscle3.6/muscle3.6.html)
**Installation** is done following below command line:

```bash
sudo apt-get install muscle
```

## 3) Command lines to build the package
### Build the packages
**Packages** are quite simple to use. 
Start by writting the below command line to build the package:
```bash
sudo g++ -o profile main.cpp Profile.cpp -std=c++11
```

### Execute the packages
Next, use the below command line to execute the packages: 
```bash
./profile 
```

When alignment has finished, ``profile`` will display the matrix of frequency of each amino acid in the query and template sequences.
